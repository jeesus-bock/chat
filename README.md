# Chat

A proof-of-concept implementation of a Gofiber websocket and HTTP APIs that use NATS on the backend.

The work is very much in progress but the basics of both NATS and websocket are in working state.

API ought to be defined better, among other things

# Running
- Git clone repo
- go get
- go build
- Start NATS server, more info https://github.com/jeesus-bock/natikka
